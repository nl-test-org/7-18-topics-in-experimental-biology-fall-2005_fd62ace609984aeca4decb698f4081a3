This independent experimental study course is designed to allow students with a strong interest in independent research to fulfill the project laboratory requirement for the Biology Department Program in the context of a research laboratory at MIT. The research should be a continuation of a previous project under the direction of a member of the Biology Department faculty.

This course provides instruction and practice in written and oral communication. Journal club discussions are used to help students evaluate and write scientific papers.
